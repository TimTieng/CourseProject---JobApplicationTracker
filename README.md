# CourseProject---JobApplicationTracker

This is a project that addresses the MSSA student needs of finding potential career opportunities after the MSSA.
Additionally, this provides Program Site manangers the ability to keep track of their students application process (On-Going).
This project showcases my knowledge of C#, ASP.NET Core, and Database migrations to create a functioning app that implements
basic "CRUD" (Create, retreive, Update, Delete) feature.
